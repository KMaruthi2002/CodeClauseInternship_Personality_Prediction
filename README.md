Internship Domain: Artificial Intelligence Intern
Project Level: Golden Level
Aim:
To develop an AI-driven system that predicts an individual's personality traits by analyzing their Curriculum Vitae (CV) or resume.

Project Description:
This project focuses on creating a sophisticated personality prediction system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze textual content in CVs. The system will extract essential information from resumes, including:

Educational Background: Degrees, institutions, and years attended.
Work Experience: Job titles, companies, durations, and responsibilities.
Skills: Technical and soft skills listed.
Achievements: Notable accomplishments, certifications, and awards.
By applying advanced techniques such as sentiment analysis, linguistic pattern recognition, and established personality trait models (e.g., the Big Five personality traits), the system will predict personality characteristics, including:

Extroversion
Conscientiousness
Openness
Agreeableness
Neuroticism
